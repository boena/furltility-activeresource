=========================

A simple yet very effective library to get awesome-looking URLs in Ruby on Rails, without a database table to handle it. Also, since ID is included in the URL it will keep history if you ever change the property of the page.

Instead of a URL like:
http://www.palooza.se/project/1

The URL will now look like:
http://www.palooza.se/project/1-my-awesome-project
